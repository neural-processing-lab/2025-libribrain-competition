## Rules

This challenge encourages everyone to join and helps us bring forth the societal impact of
speech decoding technologies.

- No domain specific knowledge or specialised hardware is required.

- Even though our goal is to democratise the field of speech decoding, we are aware that
previous breakthroughs in AI were the result of accumulating more data and computational
resources. To resolve this tension, we are splitting the competition into two different tracks.

- In the "Standard Track" participants may only make use of the LibriBrain training dataset as
part of their solutions, allowing teams with fewer resources to compete by innovating on the
methods side.

- In the "Extended Track", there are no limits to the training data that participants can use,
and which they they believe will improve their solutions.

- To encourage diversity, teams can submit to all tracks and their progress will be shared on
the relevant leaderboards. However, to encourage diversity, any team will only be allowed
to win prize money for one track. If the same team were to win multiple tracks, then they
would still be credited on the leaderboards, but the next teams in the ranking would split any
additional prize money.

- The organisers strongly encourage all participants to share their code in the spirit of open-
science.

- The organisers will reach out to participants on the "Standard" track who could win prizes
to verify that their solutions are not dependent on external datasets, and to participants on
the "Extended" track to query the amount of compute used for a discussion at the NeurIPS
session on computational efficiency.

- To avoid data leakage, the final ranking of solutions will be performed based on independent
holdout data.

- The top 3 confirmed submissions will be winners, provided that they can beat the published
benchmarks for each task. In the unlikely event of a tie, the prize will be split.
