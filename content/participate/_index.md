  Once you are ready to start you can read about the [competition rules](../rules), the [different tasks](../tracks) and how submissions will be evaluated.

---

### 2. Play Around With the Data and Different Tasks

You can play around with the data and check the different tasks using our tutorials:

1. **Speech Detection**  
  ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/speech-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Speech_Detection.ipynb))
2. **Phoneme Classification**  
  ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/phoneme-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Phoneme_Classification.ipynb))

---

### 3. Prepare Submission

You can now start working on your solution, when ready to submit, check out the tutorial here to see how to generate a submission file


* **How to generate a submission file**

### 4. Submit on EvalAI
After obtaining your predictions in CSV format from the previous step, submit them by following the steps mentioned below:
1. Create an account on [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/).

2. Go to the [challenge page](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2504/overview).

3. Click on [participate](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2504/participate) and create a participant team.

4. Select appropriate phase and upload your predictions by selecting _Upload file_ as submission type.
   <img src="../images/evalai_submission.png" style="width: 1170px; height: 415px: cover; border-radius: 8px; display: block; margin: auto;"/>

Additionally, we also recommend that participants have a look at the EvalAI documentation on [participating in a challenge](https://evalai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/participate.html).

### 5. Check Performance on Leaderboards
You can then check the evaluation metrics and the leaderboards to see how your solution is performing.
- **Speech Detection:**  
  [Standard Track](../leaderboard/speech_detection_standard) | [Extended Track](../leaderboard/speech_detection_extended)
- **Phoneme Classification:**  
  [Standard Track](../leaderboard/phoneme_classification_standard) | [Extended Track](../leaderboard/phoneme_classification_extended)
