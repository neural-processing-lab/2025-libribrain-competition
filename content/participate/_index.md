---

### 2. Play Around With the Data and Different Tasks

You can play around with the data and check the different tasks using our tutorials:

1. **Speech Detection**  
  ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/speech-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Speech_Detection.ipynb))
2. **Phoneme Classification**  
  ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/phoneme-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Phoneme_Classification.ipynb))

---

### 3. Prepare Submission

You can now start working on your solution, when ready to submit, check out the tutorial here to see how to submit your solution


* **How to submit your solution**

---

### 4. Submit on EvalAI
To be updated

---

### 5. Check Performance on Leaderboards
You can then check the evaluation metrics and the leaderboards to see how your solution is performing.
- **Speech Detection:**  
  [Standard Track](../leaderboard/speech_detection_standard) | [Extended Track](../leaderboard/speech_detection_extended)
- **Phoneme Classification:**  
  [Standard Track](../leaderboard/phoneme_classification_standard) | [Extended Track](../leaderboard/phoneme_classification_extended)
