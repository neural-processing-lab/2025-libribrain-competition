## Participate
We're excited for you to get started! Here are some resources to help you along the way:

* You can get play around with the data and check the different tasks using our tutorials:
  * Speech Detection ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/speech-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Speech_Detection.ipynb))
  * Phoneme Classification ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/phoneme-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Phoneme_Classification.ipynb))
* Once you are ready to start you can read about the [competition rules](../rules), the [different tasks](../tracks) and how submissions will be evaluated.
* You can now start working on your solution, when ready to submit, check out the tutorial here to see how to submit your solution ([Download](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/submission-colab) | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neural-processing-lab/2025-libribrain-competition/blob/main/static/colabs/LibriBrain_Competition_Submission_Tutorial.ipynb))
* You can then check the evaluation metrics and the leaderboards to see how your solution is performing.
  * Speech Detection: [Standard Track](../leaderboard/speech_detection_standard) | [Extended Track](../leaderboard/speech_detection_extended)
  * Phoneme Classification: [Standard Track](../leaderboard/phoneme_classification_standard) | [Extended Track](../leaderboard/phoneme_classification_extended)
* If you have any questions or need help, please check our [Discord server](https://neural-processing-lab.github.io/2025-libribrain-competition/links/discord) or send us your questions to: [libribrain@robots.ox.ac.uk](mailto:libribrain@robots.ox.ac.uk)
