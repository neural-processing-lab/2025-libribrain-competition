### Submissions for 2025 are now closed

We want to extend a warm thank you to all authors and teams for their excellent submissions! We're excited about the quality and diversity of approaches submitted this year.

> **For authors:** Please submit a final, de-anonymised version of your paper when you get around to it—ideally within two weeks. We understand that many of you are currently busy with NeurIPS, so there's no rush.

> **Important:** Please note the updated template! We've made some changes, and you should switch to using it for your final version. The good news is that you can simply swap the `.sty` file—no need to restructure your document.
