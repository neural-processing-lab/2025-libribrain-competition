## LibriBrain Competition 2025

The LibriBrain Competition presented in NeurIPS 2025 invites AI researchers and students to take part in the exciting challenge of decoding language from the brain. The societal impact of a functioning brain computer interface systems will be substantial - first for people with speech related disabilities, and eventually as a new paradigm for interaction with computers. 

We believe that the way forward for advancing this impactful technology is through standardization and easy accessibility for the broader research community. Our goal is to spark an "ImageNet moment" for BCI, lowering the barrier of entry for researchers to contribute to this exciting new field.
