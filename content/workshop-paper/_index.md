## Workshop Paper Submission

---
As part of the workshop at NeurIPS accompanying the competition at NeurIPS 2025, we have put out a Call for Workshop Papers. The primary intention behind this is to invite teams to present their approaches and results. On this page, we've compiled compiled information to guide you through the process.


### 1. General info
- Please use the official template and follow the page limits and anonymization rules described in the template.
- Page limit: 4 pages (excluding references + optional appendix)
- Submission: Double-blind (do not reveal author identities in the PDF)
- Deadline: Please submit your paper until 09.11. (AoE)
- Review: We will hold a lightweight review process, for which we _may_ assign you one paper to review. Details on this will follow.

If you have questions, contact us on Discord or via email.

### 2. Preliminary timeline
The timeline below is subject to change.

| Date   | Milestone                                    |

### 4. Submission form
If the embedded form below does not work, please follow [this link](https://tally.so/r/3lpQNo). Please submit either a PDF or, if you wish to include additional technical appendices, a ZIP file. Make sure that your submitted paper is anonymised. Per team, we will consider the final submission before the deadline. This means that if you wish to update your existing submission, you should simply resubmit the form with the updated file.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 110%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
