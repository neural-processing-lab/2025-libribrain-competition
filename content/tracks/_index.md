## Tasks
The **LibriBrain Competition** features two core tasks in decoding language from MEG recordings of brain activity:

- **Speech Detection**  
  Train a model to distinguish *speech* vs. *silence* based on brain activity measured by MEG during a listening session.

- **Phoneme Classification**  
  Build a classifier that maps MEG data to the specific **phonemes** being heard.

## Tracks

We offer two tracks per task to balance resource constraints with open exploration:

| Track        | Allowed Training Data      | Focus                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Standard** | LibriBrain only            | Level playing field — innovate on methods    |
| **Extended** | Any (public or private)    | Embrace scale — “learn anything you want”    |

Regardless of training data, all tracks will be evaluated on a shared competition holdout set to better measure progress.

> You’re welcome to enter any and all tracks. To encourage participation, prize money will be awarded to each team **only once**: if you place in multiple tasks/tracks, then the lower prize you would win rolls down to the next eligible team.
